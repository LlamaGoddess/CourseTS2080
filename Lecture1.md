## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

Objects, Classes, Encapsulationn, abstraction, Inheritence, and Polymorphism. 

## What are the main principles of OOP?

Encapsulationn, abstraction, Inheritence, and Polymorphism. ##honestly I have no clue what differentiates the 2. question from the 3. I'm answering with the main pillars

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is bundling multiple peices of data and methods into one object

## Abstraction

Abstraction is Taking something you need from something you dont always understand; for example importing a library and using some functions

## Inheritance

Inheritance is for example when you have a parent class you make a child class that inherits its methods and properties, this child class has the ability to have itds own properties and functions, and it can also override stuff from the parent class
## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is to take something someelse has made and change it to fit your needs/ override it main concept in method overriding method overriding cannot be done within a class
